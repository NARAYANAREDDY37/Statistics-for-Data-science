# Statistics-for-Data-science

- **Mean** --> mean is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection

- **Median** --> A median is a value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population or a probability distribution.

- **variance** --> Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. Informally, it measures how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average value.

- **standard deviation** --> Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. It essentially measures the absolute variability of a random variable.

- **covariance** --> covariance is the statistical measure of the degree to which the two variables are moving together 

- **Null Hypothesis** --> The null hypothesis is a general statement that states that there is no relationship between two phenomenons under consideration or that there is no association between two groups. 

- **Alternative Hypothesis** --> An alternative hypothesis is a statement that describes that there is a relationship between two selected variables in a study.

- **Central limit theorem** --> The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.

- **P-value** --> The p value is the evidence against a null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis. P values are expressed as decimals although it may be easier to understand what they are if you convert them to a percentage. For example, a p value of 0.0254 is 2.54%. This means there is a 2.54% chance your results could be random (i.e. happened by chance). That’s pretty tiny. On the other hand, a large p-value of .9(90%) means your results have a 90% probability of being completely random and not due to anything in your experiment. 

- **Probability Distributions** --> We can define probability as the percent chance that some event will occur. In data science this is commonly quantified in the range of 0 to 1 where 0 means we are certain this will not occur and 1 means we are certain it will occur. A probability distribution is then a function which represents the probabilities of all possible values in the experiment

- **Uniform Distribution** --> It has a single value which only occurs in a certain range while anything outside that range is just 0. It’s very much an “on or off” distribution. We can also think of it as an indication of a categorical variable with 2 categories: 0 or the value. Your categorical variable might have multiple values other than 0 but we can still visualize it in the same was as a piecewise function of multiple uniform distributions.

- **Normal Distribution** --> It is commonly referred to as a Gaussian Distribution, is specifically defined by its mean and standard deviation. The mean value shifts the distribution spatially and the standard deviation controls the spread. The import distinction from other distributions (e.g poisson) is that the standard deviation is the same in all directions. Thus with a Gaussian distribution we know the average value of our dataset as well as the spread of the data i.e is it spread over a wide range or is it highly concentrated around a few values.
