- **Mean** --> mean is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection

- **Median** --> A median is a value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population or a probability distribution.

- **variance** --> Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. Informally, it measures how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average value.

- **standard deviation** --> Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. It essentially measures the absolute variability of a random variable.

- **covariance** --> covariance is the statistical measure of the degree to which the two variables are moving together 

- **Null and alternative Hypothesis** -->
