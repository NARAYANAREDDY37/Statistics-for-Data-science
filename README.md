# Statistics-for-Data-science

- **Mean** --> mean is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection

- **Median** --> A median is a value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population or a probability distribution.

- **variance** --> Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. Informally, it measures how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average value.

- **standard deviation** --> Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. It essentially measures the absolute variability of a random variable.

- **covariance** --> covariance is the statistical measure of the degree to which the two variables are moving together 

- **Null Hypothesis** --> The null hypothesis is a general statement that states that there is no relationship between two phenomenons under consideration or that there is no association between two groups. 

- **Alternative Hypothesis** --> An alternative hypothesis is a statement that describes that there is a relationship between two selected variables in a study.

- **Central limit theorem** --> The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.

- **P-value** --> The p value is the evidence against a null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis. P values are expressed as decimals although it may be easier to understand what they are if you convert them to a percentage. For example, a p value of 0.0254 is 2.54%. This means there is a 2.54% chance your results could be random (i.e. happened by chance). That’s pretty tiny. On the other hand, a large p-value of .9(90%) means your results have a 90% probability of being completely random and not due to anything in your experiment. 

- **Probability Distributions** --> We can define probability as the percent chance that some event will occur. In data science this is commonly quantified in the range of 0 to 1 where 0 means we are certain this will not occur and 1 means we are certain it will occur.
